This assignment has two parts, requiring you to demonstrate the following key IT skills:

<ol>

 <li>Compare and contrast the different Intel processors in Android phone and tablets.</li>

 <li>Practice converting between decimal and binary. This is the language of the computer, so you need this skill to understand how a computer works</li>

</ol>

Instructions

Write a paper that is 3–5 pages in length. In your paper:

<ul>

 <li>Compare and contrast the different Intel processors in Android devices (phones and tablets).</li>

 <li>Create a table of 32-bit word lengths that shows decimal 0-100 in both binary and hexadecimal. For example, decimal 1 is 00000000000000000000000000000001 in binary.</li>

 <li>Show how you convert a decimal to binary, binary to hexadecimal, hexadecimal to binary, and decimal to hexadecimal. For example, 2 in decimal is 000000000000000000000000000010 in binary and 2 in hexadecimal.</li>

 <li>Describe how the concepts and activities presented in the labs this week relate to this assignment.</li>

</ul>
